## Install

By running one of the following commands, the latest version of `sq` command will be installed.

If you have a permission to write a file into `/usr/local/bin` directory (e.g. you are `root` user), please run the command below:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitbears-dev/sq/master/install.sh | bash
```

If you do not have a permission to write a file into `/usr/local/bin` directory, please run either of the following commands.

If you are in sudoers and want to install `sq` command to `/usr/local/bin`:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitbears-dev/sq/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

or

If you are not in sudoers or want to install `sq` command to other directory e.g. `$HOME/bin`:

```shell
mkdir -p "$HOME/bin"
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitbears-dev/sq/master/install.sh | BINDIR="$HOME/bin" bash
```

You can change `"$HOME/bin"` in the command above to wherever you want.

If you want to upgrade the `sq` command, you can just run the same command you used to install `sq` again.

If you want to uninstall the `sq` command, you can just remove `sq` executable file you have installed.

If the commands above did not work well, or if you want to install older version of `sq` command, you can download a package file that match the environment of the target from [Releases page](https://github.com/bitbears-dev/sq/releases), unpack it, and place the executable file in the directory where included in `PATH`.
